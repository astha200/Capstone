Breast Cancer Detection - Capstone Project

1. Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on MIAS dataset available on Kaggle to detect the
presence of a tumor in mammographically captured images and further classify it into the type of cancer.
2. Employed data augmentation and various image processing techniques like median filtering, scaling, CLAHE
normalization, edge detection etc. resulting in the enhancement of classification accuracy to 97%.
